# Team_Alpha_Schedule_Planner
This is a Hackathon project for the Macewan University Computer Science Club by: (in no particular order) Ayub, Brant, Tarik and Ashley.

This html website is a simple schedule planner. The user can add events with an event name, date, time, and details.

It displays the events sorted by date and time, or by name.

Underneath each event is the amount of time left before it begins. Ex: Christmas, 27 days 5:25:00

If you hover over an event, it displays the details and the time it begins.

To save your events, click the download button at the top of the website. This downloads a file containing your events, that you can upload on a later visit.

It's Not a Bug, It's a Feature: Each event is displayed as 1 hour earlier than entered, so you are never ever late! :)
